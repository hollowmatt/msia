# Database Setup

Once you have the environment up and running with docker-compose, you will need to 

1. Create the Database (video-streaming)
2. Create the collection in that database (videos)
3. Insert the document to the database

```
{
    "_id" : { "$oid": "5d9e690ad76fe06a3d7ae416" },   
                                                      
    "videoPath" : "SampleVideo_1280x720_1mb.mp4"      
                                                      
}

```
